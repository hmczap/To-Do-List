To Do List is a command-line application that can be used to write a to-do list and 
display it in the terminal. Tasks are given a name, brief description (limited to 250
characters), and level of priority. By default, if priority is not assigned to a task, 
the default priority is low, such that new tasks will be added to the bottom of the list.

To Do List will also track the tasks you have completed today.

[Future] you are able to restore tasks that were previously completed to the pending list
         of tasks, if needed.

Use the main menu to add tasks to the list, resolve them, remove them from the list.

[Future] The settings menu can be used to customize the style and colour of the list.

         Priority Mode          The top 3 tasks with the highest priority are printed to
                                the console. Other tasks can be cycled using the D (down)
                                and U (up) key.

         Full Mode              All tasks on the to do list are displayed in the console
                                in no particular order, including their full description.
        
         Condensed Mode         All tasks on the to do list are displayed by name only
                                (description is omitted). Task descriptions will be stored
                                but not displayed in this mode - to view task descriptions
                                the user must switch to full mode.
